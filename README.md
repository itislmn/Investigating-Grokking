# Investigating-Grokking
In this project I am researching an academic phenoma called Grokking, which can be witnessed as a sudden generalisation even after initial overfitting and memorisation of training datasets. However grokking can best be observed under certain conditions which include the weight decay, learning rate, problem-set, transformer architecture and much more which I aim to experiment in the project. In fact even after a long experimental period (10^6 epochs/3days runnin time on a binary XOR problem-set) it might not grok at all, with interestingly small signs of increases in validation scores:

Therefore I am keen on experimenting on this captivating but also maybe not so practical phenomena to understand on why it occurs.
